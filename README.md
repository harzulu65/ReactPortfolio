# React Portfolio

## Note for Heroku loading: The page takes some time to load, please be patient as the Landing page is completed, once the landing page is visibile the app can be tested.

The landing page has my personal picture and the title Full Stack Web Developer.

The use of the App is pretty easy, it has horizontal menu at the top of each page as well as vertical menu on the left hand side.

## Note for Projects Section: This is a list of my projects, I will put more projects than the ones present.

## Note for the About Section: Still needs refinement.

Most of the notes above are for if the test id done prior to Wednesday the 18th of November 2020, I need to present complete the App in this date.
